		<description>Nets were a highly in demand commodity on Pyandonea, and [PAWN_nameDef] took great advantage of it. [PAWN_pronoun] would always spread the many uses of nets to any potential customers, and even managed to gain the eyes of a few high ranking members of a pirate band.</description>

		<description>[PAWN_nameDef] was a rather skilled smith, and had produced many of the weapons used by the Maormeri Navy, and quite a few of the ones used by the various Maormer pirate groups. [PAWN_nameDef] didn't really care who made the orders, as coin is coin.</description>
